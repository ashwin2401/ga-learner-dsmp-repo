### Project Overview

 Insurance claim prediction is categorical dataset thats why i selected to use logistic regression,  In this project we need to predict  Insurance claim which is our targeted variable once we get to know then we perform analysis on basis of that like applying models such as Logistic regression and GridsearchCV and at last to plot it and view the accuracy score which we get around 0.87.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned to apply Logistic Regression model and metrics ,roc_auc scores,accuracy to and why we choose the Logistic model for this problem statement.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Initially i go with feature selection process firstly i separated the targeted variable and features then  with the help of train_test_split i splitted  it ,  then i checked the correlation with every features  after checking the correlation i finally choosed the Logistic model and fitted it. And  at final conclusion i got the better accuracy


### Challenges faced

 The challenges are always come with difficulties these dataset also comes with we need to dig and analys every features to get the better accuracy score.

### Project Overview

 For this project we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back

The data that we have is from 2007-2010.

Using Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, we had a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model. In this project, we applied the following concepts.

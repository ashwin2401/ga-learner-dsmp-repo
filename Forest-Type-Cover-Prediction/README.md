### Project Overview

 This repository contains a multi class classification project implemented using different feature selection techniques to improve model performance.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I now have the better understanding of how feature selection effects the performance of a machine learning model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

How are the features important to our model.
How to select the most significant features out of many.
How to perform univariate feature selection.
How to perform multivariate feature selection.
